## Standard Partnership Deal

The Standard Partnership Deal was passed by DAO vote:
https://snapshot.org/#/vote.upstreetai.eth/proposal/0x97b2437ceb75f587c8412c90408fdf62b1d0486fdf388393188ca058031d42d9

These partnerships are win/win and best suited for 3D and VRM NFT projects, embassies with other metaverse platforms and anything that is obviously win/win.

The dev team is authorized to extend these terms to partners:
- Exchange equal or fair value in digital assets, up to 10 lands
- Exchange social media support
- Allow project shilling to holders in public channels around release
- Team MUST build or commission an HQ in Upstreet
- Both sides agree not to list traded assets or take any action that lowers floor price
- Land is provided by the DAO treasury allocation
